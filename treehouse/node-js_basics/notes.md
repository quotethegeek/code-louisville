#Node.js Basics Notes

Node.js can perform other tasks whilst it waits on others to complete

###JavaScript in the Browser
Native Objects
* String
* Array
* Date
* Math
* Et al..

Host Objects
* Window
* Document
* History
* XMLHttpRequest (Ajax)
* Et al..

###Node.js Platform: Node.js uses Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
Native Objects
* String
* Array
* Date
* Math
* Et al..

Host Objects
* http
* https

* Et al..
This allows JS to work outside the browser
